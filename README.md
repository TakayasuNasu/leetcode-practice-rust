### Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

The first collection type weâ€™ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a vector. Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.

### BST's (binary search trees)

### Graph

### DFS: depth-first search

### BFS: breadth-first search
